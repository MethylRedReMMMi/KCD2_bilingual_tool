<Row><Cell>bez_na_au_kdyz_ale_doslo__dQ51</Cell><Cell>What surprised me, though, was that the Margrave has no intention of doing anything to save Sir Hans. He claimed that Bergow would want a ransom, so Hans's fate would be in the hands of his family, headed by Lord Hanush. Zizka, evidently angry, arrived at the audience, having just discovered why Dry Devil wasn't at the fortress. Jobst had refused to provide him refuge. Things were very tense and it seemed that Zizka was going to explode. It ended with the Margrave forbidding us from leaving Suchdol.</Cell><Cell>然而，令我惊讶的是，侯爵根本不打算拯救汉斯爵士。他声称冯·波尔高会想要赎金，因此汉斯的命运将掌握在他家人，尤其是瀚纳什爵士手中。就在这时，目露凶光的杰式卡冲进门来。他刚刚发现“酒鬼”之所以不在堡垒，是因为约布斯特拒绝为他提供庇护。形势瞬间变得严峻，杰式卡都要气炸了。侯爵表示如果我们离开苏赫多尔就需要承担后果。</Cell></Row>

I'm worried whether he's still alive.</Cell><Cell>与侯爵的会面相当有趣。当听到冯·波尔高一直在欺骗我们时，他一点也不惊讶，甚至像是早有预料一般。我们谈话期间还提到了列支敦士登，他不知何故音信全无，和约布斯特断了联系。我很担心他现在是否安好。</Cell></Row>

<Row><Cell>jdi_na_tu_turnajova_pravi_Tvut</Cell><Cell>The rules of the tournament are simple. 
I have to wait for Fridusch to announce my duel and get into the pen with the correct gear. 
Then comes the actual duel. I'll need to beat my opponent twice to advance to the final round and then do the same to win the final. 
If I win the final round, I'll get the prize for the chosen discipline. 
For the sword and shield and longsword disciplines, I must use borrowed tournament gear, including the weapon and shield. I shouldn't forget to return the gear afterwards. 
The free combat discipline allows me to use any armour and melee weapon I bring with me. 
All in all, I just need to use common sense, listen to Fridusch, not be an arsehole and not commit any crimes during the tournament.</Cell><Cell>比武的规则非常简单。
首先，我得等候弗里杜斯宣布对局开始，随后再携带合规的武器进入比武场地。
其次，在比武的过程中，我得击败对手两次才能晋级决赛，并在决赛中同样击败对手两次方可取得最终胜利。
一旦赢得决赛，我将获得所选比武项目提供的奖赏。
若要参与剑盾项目或长剑项目，我必须借用主办方提供的包括武器与盾牌在内的比武装备，但也别忘了事后将装备如数归还。
自由搏斗项目将允许我使用随身携带的任意护甲装备与近战武器。
总而言之，保持平常心态，听从弗里杜斯安排，在比武期间别当混蛋，更别犯罪。</Cell></Row>

He said he really worked for some nobleman, but he doesn't know which one. The job was indirectly given to him by a Jew named Samuel, who's connected with the King Solomon Tavern in the Jewish Quarter. Goatskin heard the name Liechtenstein a few times when this Samuel was talking with his cronies. But it's hard to say what that means. They could have been talking about Liechtenstein for any number of reasons. </Cell><Cell>抓到山羊皮之后，就很容易了。这个混蛋害怕挨打，他甚至没有反抗。他说他真的为某个贵族工作，但不知道是哪一个。这份工作是一个叫塞缪尔的犹太人间接派给他的，塞缪尔和犹太区的所罗门王酒馆有关联。在塞缪尔与亲信交谈时，山羊皮听到过几次列支敦士登这个名字。但很难说是什么意思。他们谈论列支敦士登的原因可能有很多。</Cell></Row>

Take your leave of crone and maiden, standing tall behind the gates, boldly go towards true midnight, in caverns cold your prize awaits. Pass through the hall of forest kings, hidden deep from hunters' gaze, standing tall two guards of stone, behind whom yearned-for treasure lays. Between them stands a mighty rock, a subtle niche yet deeper still, a place to give one’s heart to God, behold my armour gleaming still.</Cell><Cell>寻找布伦瑞克的第一件护甲并非易事，但是稍微动动脑筋，我就能做到。抄写员盖布尔告诉了我一则谜语，会协助我达成目标，而谜语的具体内容如下：
老妪和少女，离开她们吧，就在大门之后，勇敢地踏上午夜之旅，那处冰冷的岩洞中，你的宝藏已然安睡。
深藏在猎人眼眸里的麋鹿之森，耸立着两尊巨石守卫，正守护着身后躺着的，那万人觊觎的宝藏。

He was especially proud of his bow. Maybe because it was the only thing he had ever won at dice. Janosh is from Hungary, but he can be understood when he speaks. Rumour has it he's a real drunkard.

博尔祖特如今生活磊落坦荡，与一位牧师住在格兰德。
拉涅克一如既往地热爱玩骰子，只不过水平堪忧。他也是团队里射术最好的人，手里的弓箭总让他容光焕发，或许是因为那是他玩骰子唯一赢过的东西。
亚诺什来自匈牙利，但要与之沟通并无障碍。据说他是个不折不扣的酒鬼，还与阿德尔是对形影不离的搭档，而后者是个波兰人，唯有亚诺什能真正听懂他的话。库宾卡说，只要我能找到他们之中的一人，也就能找到另一个。</Cell></Row>
